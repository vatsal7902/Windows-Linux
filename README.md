### Sharing the file from Linux to Windows using PowerShell
The project is to share a file from Linux to Windows using PowerShell. There are many ways to share a file from Linux to Windows, but we choose SCP command using PowerShell. SCP is the Secure Copy Protocol. <br>

### Windows Server Administration with Active Directory & File Management
This portfolio showcases practical experience configuring and managing Windows Server 2019 environments with a focus on Active Directory, user access control, and file system permissions. Through a series of structured labs, the work demonstrates key skills including domain controller deployment, group and user account management, roaming profiles, logon restrictions, and NTFS and share permissions. Each lab reflects a solid grasp of enterprise-level IT infrastructure, emphasizing secure, efficient, and scalable system administration practices. <br>

### Windows Server & Network Administration Experience
As a dedicated and detail-oriented IT professional, I’ve gained hands-on experience with core Windows Server functionalities through practical lab environments, including DHCP configuration and Group Policy management. From setting up IP address scopes and reservations to implementing Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for centralized control of user and computer settings, I’ve worked through real-world administrative scenarios to understand the essentials of network infrastructure and domain-level policy enforcement. These labs helped me grasp critical concepts like IP leasing vs. reservation, DHCP server authorization, and GPO inheritance and enforcement—all within a secure and structured Active Directory environment. This foundation reflects my growing proficiency in managing enterprise-grade IT systems. <br>

### Securing Windows Server (Network Infrastructure Security)
It demonstrates the configuration of secure domain join permissions by removing authenticated users, setting the ms-DS-MachineAccountQuota to zero, and delegating access to a service account within Active Directory. It includes implementing strict account policies—such as password complexity, history, aging, and lockout rules—through Group Policy Management to enforce secure authentication practices. The setup reflects real-world scenarios, emphasizing the principle of least privilege and showcasing practical skills in strengthening Windows Server network infrastructure security. <br>

### Securing Windows Server (Server Hardening)
This project demonstrates practical skills in Windows Server hardening through the implementation of Encrypted File System (EFS), Windows Firewall configurations, and Audit Policies. It covers the setup of disk encryption for data protection, creation of custom firewall rules to control network traffic (e.g., blocking ICMP), and audit logging to monitor critical security events like unauthorized access and policy changes. These tasks were performed using Group Policy Management and Event Viewer in a domain-controlled environment, reinforcing layered security measures and best practices for securing enterprise Windows Server infrastructures. <br>
